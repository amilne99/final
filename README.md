Site Description: This is a Kellogg Marketplace website that allows sellers to post a variety of items that they have for sale and buyers to browse items, make comments, and check the contact information of the seller.

There is a separate page to create a post with a link located in the top left.

The search functionality allows users to search by category, condition, or both (blanks are accepted). Please note that not every search will produce results as we haven't populated posts for all possible combinations of categories and conditions but there are items in each category and condition. 

Please note that users can't see posts until they are logged in (this is different from the wireframes and user stories submitted previously).
